Code on titan 6

The Titan 6 project aims to build a two-meter tall, six-legged "light-weight" robot. The challenge in building such a robot lies in its large size, which requires an immense amount of power. Our hope is to build a robot that breaks this curse and is both light and strong.

Included Packages:
	py_con - python controls with IK, joystick, stand/sit
	eigenbot - contains eigenbot_drivers
	titan_base - simple joint space commands for small demos

## OPERATING TITAN6

Batteries:
	Main batteries - Nominal voltage 50 v, can charge up to 5 amps
	Computer battery (LiGo) - Nominal voltage 36 v, can charge up to 3 amps

E stop (on the leg) - controls power to modules
M stop (wireless) - prevents commanded movements 

Module Lights:
	M stop engaged : yellow and red flashing
	M stop disengaged : blue and green flashing
	Encoder problem : red flashing

Running Smart Startup Script:

	Plug in LiGo, and turn it on. This will turn on the computer on Titan.
	Make sure the robot is physically in a zero position (each leg in neutral position, longest link perpendicular to the groud)
	Disengage E stop to turn on robot. (keep wireless M stop Engaged)
	Wait till the wifi network named "Titan" shows up on your laptop, connect to the Titan network using a laptop.

	From a terminal
			ssh biorobotics@titanuc
			(password is "biorobotics")

	Navigate to titanCode folder 

	run this command
		./runPyCon.sh
		(Should take 8 seconds to startup)

	Turn on joystick, and make sure the top two of the lights are on.
	Disengage M stop and control normally

	Joystick Controls:

		X - stand up/sit down
		L stick - strafe
		R stick - turn
		(EigenBus is facing forward wrt the robot)
		(Small commands go a long way!)
		(O6 is very large and will take a while to complete a step once you tell it to)

Running Joystick script Manually:

	Power On: 

		Plug LiGo battery and switch it on (There are two anderson connectors that need to be connected)

		With  M stop engaged, disengage E stop

	Connecting to onboard computer:

		TITAN wifi network will show up once the LiGo has been plugged in and powered on. Connect to TITAN from your computer
			Password: biorobotics
		(TERMINAL 1) From a terminal
			ssh biorobotics@titanuc
			(password is "biorobotics")
			(Proper directories are sourced on startup for running joystick control)

		(TERMINAL 1) Next run
			roslaunch eigenbot_driver titan_driver.launch
			(this launch the controller that allows the modules to be commanded)


	Zeroing Joints:

		With robot powered off or M stopped (it is easier to move the joints if there are no power to the modules), move all joints so that shins of robot are vertical and all waist (horizontal) joints are centered. (Note that you can turn off the modules by pressing the e stop without turning off the computer)

		Make sure the modules are on and M stopped if you turned them off in the previous step

		(TERMINAL 2) Open a new terminal and ssh into the robot computer (see "connecting to onboard computer")

		(TERMINAL 2) from this terminal run
			rostopic echo /titan/joint/fb
			(this will display all module feedback)
			(titan_driver must be launched for this comand to display module feedback)

		(TERMINAL 3) Open a new terminal and ssh into the robot computer (see "connecting to onboard computer")

		(TERMINAL 3) from this terminal navigate to titanCode
			cd titanCode

		(TERMINAL 3) from titanCode run
			./zeroJoints
			(this should set all of the module positions to zero)

		(TERMINAL 2) Look at the previous terminal and confirm that all position values are reading zero
			(some of the values will not be zero as they are the force values from the foot sensors. You can distinguish these as the corresponding index of the "name" array will be a number in the 60s)
			(Mostly we are checking to make sure none of the joints are randomly reading large numbers)

		If joint values look good after zeroing, you can disengage the M stop, otherwise, run ./zeroJoints again and check the values
			(toggling the e stop may also help if joints are still acting up)

	Running Joystick Control:

		Once titan_drivers are launched and joints are zeroed, you are ready to run Joystick Control!

		Turn on the joystick by pressing the big button in the middle 
			(the top left and top right lights should be on)
			(pressing the center button will toggle control modes)

		(TERMINAL 4) Open a new terminal and ssh into the robot computer (see "connecting to onboard computer")

		(TERMINAL 4) Now launch the ros joystick node to allow for the joystick to communicate with the robot
			rosrun joy joy_node
			(you can check to see if the joystick is sending signal by running rostopic echo joy (use another terminal for this))

		(TERMINAL 5) Open a new terminal and ssh into the robot computer (see "connecting to onboard computer")

		(TERMINAL 5) from this terminal navigate to py_con
			cd titanCode/src/py_con/

		(TERMINAL 5) from py_con run
			python3 titan.py ROS
			(this will run the controller)

	Joystick Controls:

		X - stand up/sit down
		L stick - strafe
		R stick - turn
		(EigenBus is facing forward wrt the robot)
		(Small commands go a long way!)
		(O6 is very large and will take a while to complete a step once you tell it to)

	Powering Off:

		(TERMINAL 5) Use control C while selecting the terminal running titan.py to stop the controller

		From any terminal that is SSHed and has nothing running, run
			sudo halt
			(password "biorobotics")

		Engage E stop to power off Modules

		Turn off LiGo battery

	Diagnosing Problems:

		If modules turns red, power cycling the robot should fix this 
		Leg bending inward - If you see a leg bending inward under the center body, try to support the robot best you can and M stop. This position can easily cause the leg to snap

## How it works

Titan 6's software consists of 1) the eigenbot submodule and 2) the pycon submodule. 

### Description of files

1) runPyCon.sh - script that zeroes all of Titan 6's joints (output in tmux window)

2) zeroJoints - bashcript to zero joints 

#### Eigenbot Submodule ####

Make sure to switch branch to Titan.

1) eigenbot/eigenbot_driver/launch - contains launch files

	-eigen_driver.launch
	-titan_driver.launch - starts 3 nodes for joint control in Titan 6

#### Pycon Submodule ####

1) HRDF - boilerplate data for Titan 6 

2) logs - numerical data

3) Params - parameters referenced when loading gate or hexapod object
	
	- bot_params.txt - addresses of all Titan 6's modules 

	- gait_params.txt - dictates how Titan 6 walks and stands 

4) rosbags - contains rosbag files 

5) gait.py - helper class for titan.py to store and execute gaits

	- var inc_per = number of increments within 1 step

	- def comStand = function that commands robot to stand up 

	- def comSit = function that commands robot to sit

	- def smoothSlide = creates points in robots trajectory

	- def hebiTraj = hebi trajectory 

	- def xyz2t = calculates angle of arm 

	- def manStep = activates manual mode where individual pairs of legs can be moved

6) hexapod.py - helper class for titan.py for calculating hexapod kinematics, 'step' behavior, and I/O with robot or simulation

	- def incGait = increments the active gait
	
	- def check_coll = shows whether or not robot collides (will be replaced in near future)

	- pubCommands = publishes joint angle commands (to /titan/joint/cmd) as stored in hexapod's [pos]

7) titan.py - main controller node

8) joy_reader.py - helper class for titan.py to handle joystick inputs

9) script_joy.py - node for publishing a scripted series of commands on the /joy channel and replaces use of a physical joystick as an input to titan.py

10) sim_link.py - node which echos communications to give the gazebo simulator the same rostopic interface as eigenbot_driver

11) visual_bot.py - visualization node for sending joint command and feedback states as Markers to be Visualized in rviz (havenâ€™t been used since teleop)

#### TitanBase ####

Will be used for demos.
